# Sofia's Chicken Coop Controller

I built this for me, to fit my very specific needs. I hope to document what I have done someday when I have more time when my baby gets a bit older. 


My chicken coop controller:
1. Opens the door at sunrise
2. closes the door at sunset + 30min
3. turns on a LED before sunrise to compensate for short day light days
4. controls status LEDs, 
    - door is open
    - door is closed
    - temp is colder than set min
    - temp is hotter than set max
    
 I use a Ardino Mega board
 I will someday list the specifics of the components and the board layout. It will be good for me to record the information somewher more permament than a notebook on my shelf.
